I'm forever grateful for my time in the statistics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. From my first days as a graduate student, I encountered classmates, faculty, and staff who welcomed and supported me. The rigor and high standards that they encouraged me to pursue have had an enduring impact on my views of scholarly research. I am fortunate to have had continuous financial support for my studies, in the form of assistantships or fellowships. 

Professor Yazhen Wang encouraged me to aspire to greater understanding of theoretical statistics. At times, I didn't think that I could master such material, yet he believed in me. 

I found receptive collaborators in departments that, historically, didn't emphasize statistics. 




I found support for professional development activities through the university's Delta program.
