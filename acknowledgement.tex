I'm forever grateful for my time in the statistics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. From my first days as a graduate student, I encountered classmates, faculty, and staff who welcomed and supported me. The rigor and high standards that they encouraged me to pursue have had an enduring impact on me. I am also fortunate to have had continuous financial support for my studies, in the form of assistantships or fellowships. 

Professor Yazhen Wang encouraged me to aspire to greater understanding of theoretical statistics. Professor Chunming Zhang guided me through courses in both introductory statistical inference and empirical Bayes methods. Professor Michael Newton and Professor Christina Kendziorski encouraged my interest in genetics and genomics. Bret Hanlon encouraged me to develop my research interests and ideas. 

My committee members, too, encouraged me in many ways. I am grateful to Professor Kam Tsui for his sustained support during my studies. Professor Jun Zhu supported my early teaching efforts and provided valuable feedback on my research. Professor Alan Attie was a wonderful collaborator and a source of many ideas. Professor Qiongshi Lu provided helpful and thoughtful feedback on my research and writing.

I found support for professional development and teaching activities through the university's Delta program. Don Gillian-Daniel was especially supportive and helpful. 

My advisors, Professor Brian Yandell and Professor Karl Broman, guided and supported me over the three-year duration of my thesis research. We met weekly to discuss research progress and ideas. They helped me to formulate our research goals, reviewed my early results, and greatly improved my initial presentations of our findings. I couldn't have asked for better advisors.
